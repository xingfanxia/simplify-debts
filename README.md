# Simplify-debts

Simplify debts by minimizing transactions. The algorithm does not aim in minimizing transaction amounts but only the number of transactions.

This for some reason requires python2... need to update for it to work for python3
## Run

1. Create debts file, e.g. example.txt:
```
# Everyone owes Joe
* -> Joe: 16.80
Sue -> Joe: 24.40
Bob -> Sue: 12.20
# Ellen is part of everyone
Ellen
```

2. Run:
```
$ src/simplify.py <example.txt
Bob -> Joe: 16.4
Sue -> Joe: 16.4
Ellen -> Joe: 4.2
```

## Run with [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)

```
$ src/simplify.py -g <example.txt |dot -Tpng >example.png
```

## Run tests

[Robot framework](http://robotframework.org/) required

```
$ cd test
$ pybot run-test.txt
```
